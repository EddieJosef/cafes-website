# Café Directory Web Application

This repository contains a web application that allows users to add their favorite cafés to a database, update café information, and delete entries if they have the access code. The application is built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap.

## Features

The café directory web application offers the following features:

1. **View Cafés**: Users can browse through the list of cafés stored in the database. The cafés are displayed with their names, locations, and other details.

2. **Random Café**: Users can click on the "Random" button to view a randomly selected café from the database. This feature is useful for discovering new cafés.

3. **Search for Cafés**: Users can search for cafés by name using the search functionality. If a café with the provided name exists in the database, its details will be displayed.

4. **Add Café**: Users can contribute to the café directory by adding new cafés. The "Add Café" form allows users to provide details such as the café's name, location, map URL, image URL, seating capacity, availability of toilets, Wi-Fi, sockets, ability to take calls, and coffee price.

5. **Update Café Information**: Users with the access code can update café information using the "Update Café Information" form. The form allows users to modify the café's name, location, map URL, image URL, seating capacity, availability of toilets, Wi-Fi, sockets, ability to take calls, and coffee price.

6. **Delete Café**: Users with the access code can delete a café from the database using the "Delete Café" form. The form requires users to enter the café's name and the access code to confirm the deletion.
